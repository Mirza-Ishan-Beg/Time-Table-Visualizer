Detailed Summary of WeeklySchedulePlotter Python Script

Overview
The WeeklySchedulePlotter Python script is designed to automate the process of visualizing a weekly schedule stored in an Excel file. It extracts time slots for different subjects, processes this data, and generates a polar plot that visually represents the schedule in a 24-hour clock format for each day of the week. The script employs several libraries, including matplotlib, numpy, and pandas, to facilitate data manipulation and visualization.
Key Components

    Imports
        The script begins by importing the necessary libraries:

        python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # For plotting graphs
    import numpy as np                # For numerical operations
    import pandas as pd               # For data manipulation and reading Excel files
    import re                         # For regular expressions to extract time data from strings

Class Definition: WeeklySchedulePlotter

    The main functionality of the script is encapsulated in the WeeklySchedulePlotter class.

Initialization Method (__init__)

    Signature:

    python

    def __init__(self, excel_file):

    Parameters:
        excel_file: A string that specifies the path to the Excel file containing the weekly schedule.
    Variables:
        self.df: A DataFrame that stores the content of the Excel file, created using pd.read_excel(excel_file).
        self.time_picker: A regular expression pattern r"\d{4}" used to find time entries in the format HHMM (e.g., 0930).
        self.block_picker: A regular expression pattern r'\([^@^/]+\)' used to find lesson blocks within parentheses.
        self.dic_time_lessons: An empty dictionary that will hold the processed time lessons, with days of the week as keys.
        self.day: A list of strings representing the days of the week, indexed from 0 to 6 (Monday to Sunday).
    Process Call: The process_schedule() method is called to begin processing the input data immediately upon initialization.

Data Processing Method (process_schedule)

    Signature:

    python

    def process_schedule(self):

    Purpose: This method extracts time and subject information from the DataFrame and organizes it into self.dic_time_lessons.
    Variables:
        subject: Iterates through each column in the DataFrame.
        ptr: An index counter initialized to 0, representing the current day in the week being processed.
        cell: Each entry in the column corresponding to a subject.
        matched_times_list: A list containing time entries extracted from cell using re.findall(self.time_picker, cell).
        matched_block: A string that joins lesson blocks extracted from cell using re.findall(self.block_picker, cell + "@").
    Logic:
        For each subject, if the subject is not the "DAY IN THE WEEK" column, it iterates through its entries.
        For each entry, if it is not "NONE", it extracts time and lesson block data.
        The data is organized in self.dic_time_lessons such that the keys are the days of the week and the values are lists of dictionaries with subject names and their corresponding time blocks.

Time Conversion Method (convert_times)

    Signature:

    python

    def convert_times(self, times_list):

    Parameters:
        times_list: A list of lists where each sublist contains time entries that need to be converted into hour and minute tuples.
    Returns: A list of tuples formatted as (start_hour, start_minute, end_hour, end_minute).
    Logic:
        Initializes an empty list called converted_times.
        Iterates over each time_range in times_list.
        Validates that time_range has an even number of elements, which indicates pairs of start and end times.
        Extracts the start and end times, splits them into hours and minutes, and appends the tuple to converted_times.
        Raises a ValueError if any time range does not have an even number of elements.

Clock Plotting Method (plot_clock)

    Signature:

    python

    def plot_clock(self, highlighted_times, custom_tags=None, save_path=None, day_index=0):

    Parameters:
        highlighted_times: A list of tuples containing the start and end times for highlighting in the clock.
        custom_tags: An optional list of strings for tagging the highlighted time ranges.
        save_path: A string specifying where to save the generated plot.
        day_index: An integer representing the index of the current day (default is 0 for Monday).
    Logic:
        Creates a polar subplot with a specified figure size.
        Sets the background color of the plot to black.
        Defines num_segments to represent the total number of minutes in a 24-hour period (1440 minutes).
        Plots the circular background of the clock.
        Draws lines to indicate minute and hour segments, with varying styles for different intervals.
        Fills segments for the highlighted time ranges, adjusting the angles accordingly.
        Places text labels at the midpoint of each time range to indicate start and end times, as well as any associated tags.
        Configures the plot title to indicate the day of the week and saves the figure if a save_path is provided.

Plot Generation Method (generate_plots)

    Signature:

    python

    def generate_plots(self):

    Purpose: This method iterates over each day of the week and generates a clock plot for the scheduled times.
    Logic:
        Initializes a counter c for indexing the days of the week.
        Iterates over self.dic_time_lessons to extract tags and times for each day.
        Converts the extracted times using the convert_times() method.
        Calls the plot_clock() method to create and save the plot for the current day, incrementing c after each plot.

Main Execution Block

    Signature:

    python

        if __name__ == "__main__":

        Logic:
            Specifies the Excel file path (e.g., "Weekly_Schedule.xlsx").
            Instantiates the WeeklySchedulePlotter class with the specified Excel file.
            Calls generate_plots() on the instance to produce the clock plots for the weekly schedule.

Usage Instructions

To use this script:

    Ensure the required libraries (matplotlib, numpy, pandas, and re) are installed and configured correctly.
    Verify that the Microsoft Visual Studio Redistributable (2019) is set up as it is required for matplotlib.
    Create an Excel file named "Weekly_Schedule.xlsx" that includes the weekly schedule formatted with subjects and time slots.
    Run the script in an environment that supports these libraries, and it will generate high-resolution clock images for each day of the week, saving them in a directory called timetables_chart.

Conclusion

The WeeklySchedulePlotter class is a comprehensive tool for extracting and visualizing weekly schedules from Excel files. By leveraging pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for graphical representation, it effectively communicates scheduling information in a user-friendly clock format.
